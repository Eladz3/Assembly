Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, the user would use switches to input a binary value ranging from 0000 to 1111. There are 3 outputs:
Part A - gives the Hexidecimal interpretation of the binary input.
Part B - gives the last 3 significant digits of the square of the input value.
Part C - gives a specific output value for (only) 3 inputs, with either a SOP circuit, circuit of only NAND gates,
	 or circuit of only NOR gates. 
Part D - gives the correct signed decimal value with regards to binary input. (0111 = 7, 1000 = -8, etc.)
